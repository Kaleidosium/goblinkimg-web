# Notes for GoblinKimg's website

## TODO Implement

- Add "fun" button*

- Make the site responsive
  - Use proper BEM
  - Get rid of inline styles

- Put values in a config.json file
  - I think using json5 would be best
- Add "lightweight" markdown code to make content editing easier (<https://github.com/developit/snarkdown>)

\* Needs help from Coop
